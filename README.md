# Google_Integration
I did a project to get the data from google fit database and save it in mine and later analyse it.
1. Make sure you have Visual studio and the correct C# compiler and the libraries installed.
2. Now that we are set with that download the Zip file and extract it to a certain folder and open that folder in visual      studio.
3. Then you will be able to preview the code to run it you might have to cange the Mongo DB connection string, and logics.
